# OpenGL-2D-to-3D-Project

## How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  - This was an entire new skill for me and I was really excited to learn how to create a scene in OpenGL. Especially when I found out how many games are created through OpenGL and how many of my old favorites were created through it. Creating a scene like I did was really awesome and it dipped my toes in game development.
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
  - I didn't follow any particular design process. Much of the work was staged where each week we learned a new skill and applied it to our project. I used the LearnOpenGL website to get an understanding of the concepts and once I grew a better understanding I incorporated these concepts into my own work and created my own objects, textures, etc. Most of the work was done towards the end once all the concepts were brought together. I would say each week I worked on a skill, learned it, incorporated it into my project, made sure everything ran, made changes as needed, ran the project to ensure successful execution then upload work for the week. Rinse and repeat every week.
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  - This would be a good design approach to use for the future because learning and applying concepts step by step helps to understand the entire work as a whole much better. Sometimes when you look at new code it seems overwhelming and foreign but once you start from the basics and move up it becomes much easier.

## How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? 
  - I used more of an iterative approach of planning what I wanted to do for that week, how I want to do it and what I want to achieve. I would create a piece of work and test it. Whenever a new piece is added I tested my work and made sure everything ran smoothly before moving on to the next piece. At the end of the week I made sure that all my work met the requirements of the assignment before submitting it.
- How did iteration factor into your development?
  - It was a big factor because it is the way the entire project was complete. Every week was a new iteration of planning, designing, implementing, testing and evaluation.
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  - I grew more confident in my skills each week and started to really see how I can recreate my 2D scene. Each step in my process was becoming more specific and exact as well as the development started to become much quicker. The concepts made more sense and I was seeing the end result in my head much clearer. It was really awesome to see where I was in week 1 and the final project I have now.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  - I can definitely say I learned a lot from this course. It was a bumpy ride in the beginning but it came together very well. There's a lot of knowledge that I gained from this that I will use in future courses that involve object creation, texturing, positioning, etc.
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  - I was really excited about this course because I want to get into game development so this was a huge intro into that for me. It is why I wanted to create a scene of a room instead of just some simple objects as well. I wanted to push myself to create something much more intricate to know that I could do it. I still have a lot to learn but I am happy with my final project.
